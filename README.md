# CNP9-NSP10_14-Frags
An [SGC](https://www.thesgc.org/) Open Chemical Networks Project (number 24) devoted to protein NSP10/ NSP 14. This project aims to develop potent inhibitors of NSP14/NSP10 for the treatment of (CoV-19), Targeting the NSP14 and NSP10 interacting interface with small molecules or peptides could be a smart strategy to obstruct replication processes of coronaviruses (CoVs).

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.

For the science background, head to the [wiki](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP24-NSP10_14-Frags/wiki) or check out the living paper that is being written [here](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP24-NSP10_14-Frags/wiki/The-Story-So-Far).

For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To" Area](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki)
